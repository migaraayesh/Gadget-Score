           <h1>Cyberbullying and Covid-19 by by STEVE BURGESS</h1>
            <p>
                We’ve all made fun of people sitting across the table from each other, looking at their phones and tablets instead of at the person right in front of them. Sometimes we talk to each other across the table though our phones! My wife and I have had public and (hopefully) humorous conversations on FaceBook while sitting a few feet from each other in the same room.

                More often though, we see and offer criticism of this social media behavior and tend to call it anti-social behavior.
                
                Now, with Covid-19, we’re all at home and out of school, out of work, and social-distancing. And with people needing to stay away from each other, these devices we criticize – and use – are a godsend. From our in-place shelters, we can reach out virtually to our loved ones, and order them these devices for as little as $50 if they don’t’ already have them – especially the elderly. My wife and I get face-to-face time with our son overseas through Messenger video, but aside from yelling to neighbors across the street, we’re all equivalently distant now, and for a while yet to come.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there’s a flip side. With so much time on their hands, there’s almost certain to be an increase in cyberbullying. With so much fear of “the other” – religion, ethnicity, gender orientation - there’s certain to be an increase in unwanted behavior as boredom sets in and digital mischief increases. It seems that this virus could engender viral behavior.

                Cyberbullying is characterized by hate speech, rude or sexual images, spreading of rumors, aggressive hurtful behavior spread via digital communication – phones, tablets, computers. Such cyberbullying can affect a child’s – or any person’s for that matter – mental and emotional well-being, self-image, and behavior.
            </p>
            <p>What to do?</p>
            <p>
                If you have children at home, it’s useful to put parental controls on their devices, limiting the time of usage and perhaps the sites they can visit. Encourage them to be in common areas of the home where you can observe and intervene if they are experiencing certain types of unwelcome or harmful communication.

                Don’t respond to the behavior from the bully – it is generally best not to engage the person sending out such rudeness because it is likely to escalate and persist. Much of this type of behavior is for attention-getting. Giving the offender the attention that they crave will likely encourage them to continue and to heighten the behavior.

                Take screen shots to document the behavior should you need to report it. This will help in reporting to authorities or the school if necessary. Different devices use different procedures for the purposes of screen shots. Googling your device and “screen shot” should get you to an instruction page or video. Of course, you can actually take a photo of the screen using a camera or a different phone. Be sure to get everything on the screen, including dates and times, text and pictures, handles and usernames.
            </p>
            <p>
                Block the person. Most apps and devices provide a means to block a caller, texter, or “friend” on social media for any reason whatsoever.

                If the offender is a person from your school or your child’s school, report the behavior and the person as soon as possible. Given that the school may not be answering their phones because so many are closed now, it might be best to send an email to the school. Include the documentation you’ve gathered. It is possible to file a complaint with the Department of Justice at education@usdoj.gov but do be aware that they are receiving thousands of complaints or more, so it would seem likely that you would receive more timely assistance locally.

                Perhaps most importantly, talk to your child and encourage them to express their feelings about the behavior openly and without judgement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Common Sense Media website has much advice for safety with various social media apps, such as SnapChat, TikTok, FaceBook, and Instagram. To browse such advice, point your browser at https://www.commonsensemedia.org/ and then put your cursor over the “Parents Need to Know” tab, then select the topic of particular interest from the drop-down menu.

                We live in interesting times, for sure. And they are surely challenging! But with a bit of encouragement, a bit of observation, and a bit of listening, we can make this a time to deepen relationships rather than a time of heightened abuse.

            <h1>9 Incredible Benefits of Apple Pay</h1>
            <h6> BY DALE HARRIS</h6>
            <p>
                Are you looking for convenient ways to make purchases through your smart device?
            </p>
            <p>
                Since its release in October 2014, Apple has seen the number of Apple Pay users grow to over 441 million people! Apple is known for its ease of use and reliable products, which makes the Apple Pay application a popular choice for consumers.
            </p>
            <h2>1. Simple Payments</h2>
            <p>
                Apple has simplified the payment process with its Apple Pay system. 

                This makes it an appealing option for consumers of all ages because of its ease of use. For example, after you’ve loaded your credit card onto your iPhone or Apple Watch, just look for the Apple logo at retailers you visit. 
                
                When a retailer accepts Apple Pay, you simply open the app and hold your phone up to the store’s device reader to charge your account. Learn how to setup Apple Pay to be up and running on your device in a matter of minutes!
            </p>
            <h3>2. Sanitary Option</h3>
            <p>
                With the continuing threat posed by the COVID-19 global pandemic, people across the world are looking for safer and more sanitary options in virtually every aspect of their life. 

                Apple Pay is a sanitary payment option for you to use at retailers across the country. Besides being easy to use, Apple Pay also gives you the ability to make touch-free payments. 
                
                You can have peace of mind that you are doing more to socially distance and protect you and the cashier from exposure to coronavirus. 
            </p>
            <h4>3. Increased Security</h4>
            <p>
                Apple is well-known in the tech world for being a company with its focus on giving users a safe and secure experience using their products.

                From Apple’s MacBook computers to its popular iPhone, the company takes extra steps to ensure users have a positive experience. The same goes for Apple Pay too!
                
                Once your credit card is loaded into the application, you don’t need to bring your card along anymore. Apple uses a device account number that it assigns to your credit card number so you don’t need to worry about someone obtaining it while using Apple Pay.
            </p>
            <h5>4. Smooth User Experience</h5>
            <p>
                Apple’s become the most valuable company in the world, in part by giving consumers a smooth user experience that’s unmatched by the competition. 

                Apple Pay complements the existing Apple products and services by being an easy-to-use product that can be used by people of all ages. For example, if you load many credit cards in Apple Pay, the application will allow you to choose the one to use with the mere swipe of a finger. 

                Apple uses the technology in its devices and software to load your payment options quickly!
            </p>
            <h6>5. More Opportunities to Use</h6>
            <p>
                Some consumers are wary of a new payment option because of the perception of limited merchants accept it. The same can’t be said about Apple Pay.

                Apple has put significant effort into increasing the number of locations where consumers can use Apple Pay. As of July 2020, Apple Pay is accepted by 65 percent of retail locations in the United States! 

                With the growth and popularity of Apple, it’s reasonable to believe that this figure will grow in the not too distant future. 
            </p>
            <h7>6. Person-to-Person Payments</h7>
            <p>
                Have you ever been somewhere with a friend or family member that’s forgotten their wallet? 

                Apple Pay gives you and your friends the opportunity to complete person-to-person payments through iMessage. For example, a friend owes you $20 for a dinner out, you can request the payment through Apple Pay. In a matter of seconds, your friend can read the message and process payment through Apple Pay.

                This person-to-person payment option is more secure than other payment applications because of the information encryption technology Apple uses to protect all users.
            </p>
            <h8>
                7. Leave Your Credit Card at Home
            </h8>
            <p>
                Using Apple Pay promotes your privacy and safety by allowing you to leave your credit cards at home.

                Instead of needing to carry many different credit cards or cash, you can choose to bring along your smartphone device with Apple Pay only. This means you’ve got less to keep track of and can avoid losing a credit card unnecessarily.

                It also makes you a less valuable target for a thief since you won’t have any cash or credit cards on your person when you are out.
            </p>
            <h9>8. Protect Your Personal Information</h9>
            <p> Unlike merchants that often collect a lot of personal information about you during checkout, Apple does not do the same. 

                Apple Pay protects your personal information by not providing it to retailers who accept it for payment in-store and online. Once’ you’ve uploaded your credit card information, you need to have other sensitive personal information to give your merchant.
                
                Apple Pay will give you the benefit of an easy-to-use payment system that keeps more of your sensitive information private.</p>

            <h10>9. Recurrent Online Payments</h10>
            <p>
                Apple Pay can be used online and in-person to make instant payments to retailers.

                While you may first think to use Apple Pay in a brick and mortar store location, you can make payments to online merchants and other creditors. Once you’ve used Apple Pay online, you can choose to make recurrent payments to a creditor on a weekly or monthly basis.

                This means you don’t need to worry about paying bills on time since Apple Pay will do it for you!
            </p>
            <h11>Wrapping Up: The Best Benefits of Apple Pay</h11>
            <p>
                The best benefits of Apple Pay are the ones that make your life more simple and stress-free.

                Before you decide to use Apple Pay, take the time to consider what you value in a payment application and how it will benefit your day-to-day life. By taking the time to review your options now, you will have peace of mind that Apple Pay is the right one for you when you pick it.

            <h1>The Most Common Types of Websites Explained</h1>
            <h6> BY DALE HARRIS</h6>
            <p>
                There are over 1.7 million websites worldwide, a number that climbs every day. Whether you’re considering joining that number or wondering what kinds of different websites you can check out, you might be interested to know that the majority of websites fall into a few common categories. Here are some of the most popular types of websites, with examples.
            </p>
            <h2>1. E-commerce Websites</h2>
            <p>
                These popular websites allow you to sell products to people online. Examples of this type of site include big-box retailers like Amazon or Best Buy, as well as companies like Etsy that sell handmade products. Websites that offer the ability to put items in a cart and check out quality as e-commerce websites.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Business Website</h2>
            <p>
                These kinds of websites act as dedicated online addresses for a specific business or brand. A business website will list a company’s products, services, or past work. It will also include contact information to encourage potential customers to get in touch.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Personal or Portfolio Websites</h3>
            <p>
                These are cousins to business websites, as they showcase the contact information, products, services, and work of an individual. However, they often focus on past work, acting as a literal portfolio to highlight what an individual can accomplish.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Entertainment Websites</h4>
            <p>
                These popular website options are great for anyone with a taste for humorous or interesting content. Sites like Buzzfeed offer listicles and critiques on pop culture, for example, and sites like CollegeHumor present funny entertainment.
            </p>
            <h5>5. Media Websites</h5>
            <p>
                As you’d expect, media websites offer collections of articles, videos, and guides for their readers. They can overlap with entertainment websites, as in the case of The Onion, but the most prominent include media properties that also exist as newspapers or print magazines, such as The Washington Post or National Geographic.
            </p>
            <h6>6. Educational Websites</h6>
            <p>
                Now more than ever, people are learning online—and educational websites are what makes this possible. These websites can include the websites of universities and other institutions, or they may include sites like Coursera, which offers online distance learning from a variety of sources.
            </p>
            <h7>7. Blogs</h7>
            <p>
                Blogs come in many shapes and sizes these days, with some of them offering videos and photos while others stick to the traditional, text-based “web logs” that gave blogs their name. From major brands to your neighbor next door, blogs are popular tools to discuss a huge variety of topics.
            </p>
            <h8>8. Landing Pages</h8>
            <p>
                Popular with businesses and major brands, landing pages are designed to get a reader to follow through on a single course of action, like buying a product or downloading a guide. The best of them take advantage of web design services to ensure they have a great, eye-catching appearance and powerful content.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are just a few of the most popular websites people use and create on a daily basis, but there are countless other types to choose from. If you’re interested in creating a website of your own, consider the websites above, as well as the websites you often interact with, as you narrow down your options.
            </p>

            <h9> BY DALE HARRIS</h9>
            <p>
                Did you know that the Fugaku computer in Japan is currently the fastest supercomputer in the world? It has more than 7 million cores and it will become fully operational in April 2021. Its configuration is capable of handling supercomplex problems including medical research, weather forecast, and more.

                Although no machine matches the specs of the Fugaku supercomputer, it’s good to know more about a computer’s configuration. For example, your laptop configuration dictates your gaming experience and work productivity.

                If you plan to buy a new laptop, make sure that you know more about its specs. Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about laptop specs and how to configure your laptop.

            <h2>Make Sure That You Have at Least 8GB of RAM</h2>
            <article>
                The random-access memory is more important than you might think. This is the place where applications and programs are run. The more RAM you have, the better. In our day and age, it’s recommended to have at least 8GB of RAM installed on your laptop.

                Anything less than that will make multitasking difficult, even if you’re a casual laptop user. 8GBs of RAM is usually sufficient to keep a few browser tabs open, listen to music, maybe run a game in the background, etc.

                If your budget is higher, you should go for 12GB or 16GB of RAM. This is ideal if you spend a lot of time in front of your computer and you run complex apps/games. Find out if your laptop’s RAM is also expandable. It’s nice to have a free slot where you can add 8 more GBs of RAM in the future if necessary.

            <h3>If You Watch a Lot of Movies, Go for a Larger Screen</h3>
            <article>
                You can do so much on a laptop these days such as playing games, working, rendering video files, watching movies, etc. If Netflix is your best friend and you like to spend a lot of time watching movies, make sure that you get a laptop with a screen size of at least 15.6 inches.

                This is the standard size for most laptops designed for movies and games. If you want even more visual real estate, go for a laptop with a 17.3-inch screen. This is probably the largest display size you can go for in a laptop and it offers you an immersive viewing experience.

                On the other hand, if you travel a lot and you take the laptop with you, it’s recommended to go for a smaller display. Anything under 14 inches is advisable for those who want a portable laptop. Not only that your laptop will be lighter, but it will also fit almost all bags and cases with ease.
            </article>
            <h4>Opt for a Full HD Resolution</h4>
           <article>
            Display size and display resolution are two different things. The first refers to the physical size of the screen. The second refers to the number of pixels your screen has. The more pixels, the clearer the image. 

            There are several standard resolutions you can go for when it comes to a laptop’s display. The most popular are HD (1280 x 720 pixels), full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) and 4K (3840 x 2160 pixels). Ideally, you should go for a full HD resolution if your budget allows it.
            
            A full HD display is capable of showing crisper, clearer images, and more attractive colors. Your viewing experience will be taken to the next level and you’ll see a big difference when you play games too.
            
            If your budget allows you, it’s also a good idea to go for a 4K screen, but keep in mind that this will rapidly drain battery life. If you’re a casual user and don’t really care about display resolution, you could do fine with an HD screen too. Just that you won’t get the clearest and most vivid images possible.
           </article>
           <h5>Go for an SSD if You Want a Fast Booting Time</h5>
           <article>
            SSD stands for a solid-state drive. It provides a better and more reliable way of storing data in comparison with the classic HDD. Most modern laptops come with an SSD configuration and this provides a plethora of advantages.

            First of all, SSD is insanely fast. You’ll be able to enjoy faster data transfer speeds and your operating system will load quicker too. Games run smoother when installed on SSD and so do other software programs and applications. The downside is that the SSD costs more.
            
            If you don’t plan on installing large games on your laptop, you might want to go for a configuration with 128GB or 256GB of SSD. This allows you to enjoy a smoother and quicker computer experience without spending too much money.
            
            On the other hand, if you plan to store large files on your laptop, go for a combination of SSD + HDD. install the operating system on the SSD to reap faster-loading speeds. Leave the HDD for large games, movies, and music collections.

           <h6>An i3 Is Good for Basic Needs, i5 and Higher for Advanced Users</h6>
           <article>
            Let’s talk about one of the most important components of your laptop – the CPU or central processing unit. This is the brain that makes your computer tick and puts all other components to work. If you have a high-performance CPU, chances are that your laptop will remain usable for years to come.

            Most laptops come with Intel processors because these are the most advanced. You could also go for the Ryzen processors from AMD. if you casually use your laptop and don’t need too much processing power, an Intel i3 processor should do the trick for you.
            
            This configuration is usually powerful enough to allow light multitasking, internet browsing, and playing videos on full HD resolution. However, if you want to play the latest games or render large video files, you need at least an i5 processor.
            
            Keep in mind that an i5 or i7 processor is designed for heavy users. If you plan to produce music with your laptop, edit large photos, or play the latest games, these are the processors you should look for. Be prepared to also take more money out of your pocket.
            
            Ideally, go for a processor that has at least 2 cores. Some of them have 4 or even 8 cores and this is a good thing when it comes to performance. Having more cores means that your computer is capable of doing more work and handling multitasking with ease.
           </article>
           <h7>The Video Card Should Reflect Your Daily Computer Habits</h7>
           <article>
            Apart from the processor and RAM, there’s also the video card. This is a specially-designed component that handles images, animations, videos, and anything related to visuals. Most laptops come with an integrated video card, but if you want to play the latest games, you need a dedicated one.

            For example, try to go for at least 2GB of video RAM. This means that your laptop will have 2 additional GBs of RAM just to handle images and animations. Avid gamers usually go for about 4GB of video RAM and this allows you to play most games with the details set on “Ultra”.
            
            If you routinely edit photos or render videos in special software programs, you need a better video card as well. That’s why you should analyze your computer habits and see what’s best for you – a standard integrated video card for casual users or a high-performance one for gamers and videographers.
           </article>
           <h8>Go for a Backlit Keyboard Because Why Not?</h8>
           <article>
            One of the most exciting features of a modern laptop is to have a backlit keyboard. Although most basic models don’t have this feature, it can be very practical and it’s worth spending more money to get it.

            Backlit keyboards allow you to easily type in the dark. You don’t need additional light sources, just your screen, and keyboard. Most models come with standard backlighting, but some gaming laptops allow you to configure an RGB keyboard.
            
            This means that you can assign it any color you want and even set specific colors for different groups of keys. Your laptop will look much more attractive and your gaming experience will be taken to the next level.
            
            Although you can do just fine without a backlit keyboard, why shouldn’t you have this cool feature? It adds personality to your laptop and it can increase your productivity. Be prepared to spend a little more money for a laptop with a backlit keyboard, but chances are that you won’t regret this decision.
           </article>
           <h8>Go Ahead and Find the Perfect Laptop Configuration for Your Needs!</h8>
           <article>
            Now that you’ve completed a quick course on laptop configuration and basic specs, it’s time to find your ideal machine. Go online and see multiple types of laptops with different configurations. This will help you narrow down your list and find a balance between price, performance, and portability.

            As a tip, write your priorities down. Do you use your laptop primarily for gaming? Are you a writer or videographer? Do you prefer to watch movies and online videos? Based on your preferences, you’ll eventually come up with the right decision.

            <h1>The Technology and Life Cycle of SSD - What You Need to Know</h1>
            <h6>By Nick Liu</h6>
            <article>
                With Flash Memory Summit approaching next week, I thought it would be a good time to dig into the technology and life cycle of the SSD. Unlike traditional hard drives, data storage data in SSDs is not on a magnetic surface, but rather inside of flash memory chips (NAND flash). By design, an SSD is made by a motherboard, a few memory chips (depending on the size in GB of the drive) and a controller which commands the SSD.
            </article>
            <article>
                The memory of SSDs is a non-volatile memory, in other words it's able to retain data even without power. We can imagine the data stored in the NAND flash chips as an electric charge preserved in each cell. With that in mind, the question arises: how long is the life span or life cycle of a SSD?
            </article>
            <article>
                The wear and tear of flash memory
                It is known that the writing operations wear out the memory cells of a SSD, reducing its life. But will the memories wear out all in the same way?
             </article>
            <article> 
                The memory used in flash chips is not all the same, there are actually three types of NAND:

                SLC (Single Level Cell) - 1 bits of data per cell
                MLC (Multi Level Cell) - 2 bits of data per cell
                TLC (Triple Level Cell) or 3-bit MLC - three bits of data per cell
                You can see: The more levels a cell has, the more storage space bits have in a cell, resulting in the production of higher capacity chips. Thanks to the technological advances of today we have SSDs which are able to store several GBs and are at an affordable price. No wonder that a recent report shows that the TLC memory type should equal about 50% of total NAND chips by the end of 2015, with a cost of production of about 15% - 20% less compared to MCL chips.
            </article>
            <article>
                However, there is a downside: Adding more bits to the cells reduces their reliability, durability and performance. It is quite easy to determine the state (how much space it has) of a SLC cell, as it is either empty or full, while it is more difficult to do the same for MLC and TLC cells as they have multiple states. As a result a TLC cell requires 4 times the writing time and 2.5 times the reading time of a SLC cell. When discussing the life cycle of an SSD, storing multiple bits per cell also means to speed up the wear of the NAND memory.

               A memory cell is made by a floating-gate transistor. It consists of two gates, the Control gate and the Floating gate insulated by a layer of oxide (you can see a schematic representation on the right). Each time operations are performed, e.g. programming and erasing the cell, the oxide layer that traps electrons on the floating gate wears. Consequently, as the oxide layer is weakened an electron drain from the floating gate may occur.

            </article>
            <article>
                How long do SSDs last?
            </article>
            <article>
                This is the million dollar question, obviously it's not possible to give an exact answer but... continue to read!

                The trend in terms of SSD is to focus on developing products based on 3-bit MCL (TLC) memory. TLC memory is beginning to dominate the market for SSD. In common use, it seems that the 2-bit MLC technology is excessive in terms of durability and performance, not to mention the SLC whose necessity is dwindling and is almost completely disappearing. In other words, manufacturers are giving up an extended life cycle in favor of cost reduction to allow for the expansion of flash memory and their storage capacity.

                However, it is seems that there is no worry about the duration of a SSD. In an experiment conducted by The TechReport on 6 SSDs to understand how they can withstand write operations, 2 drives out of 6 have managed writing operations for 2 PB of data and all SSDs tested were able to write hundreds of TB without problems.

                Assuming a writing of 2TB per year, according to the results of the experiment, a SSD's life span would equal 1000 years (2PB = 2000 TB / 2TB year = 1000 years). Even with an increased amount of data written to them, we would be able to use our SSD quietly for years and years and years.

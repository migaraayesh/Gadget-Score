            <h1>Photographing Wildlife: Tips to Take your Images to the Next Level</h1>
            <p>
                If photographing wildlife is something that interests you, it is possible to start getting some practice in, even if it’s only at the zoo or out in the countryside capturing images of birds and small animals. It’s a fairly specialised field, however, if you’re going to get serious. After all, animals are highly unpredictable and you’re not able to direct them as you would a human subject. There are certain tips and techniques that can give you the creative advantage, though.
            </p>
            <p>
                While you might wish to take a free online photography class, or enrol in a longer, more in-depth masterclass to enrich your skills, the following tips from the professionals will go a long way to giving you an insight into taking better wildlife images.
            </p>
            <p>The Right Equipment</p>
            <p>
                You don’t need to have every lens and gadget known to man in order to take stunning images, although when it comes to shooting wildlife it certainly helps to have a least a few different lenses. At the very least you should have a telephoto, to enable you to shoot from afar, and a good tip is to choose one with optical stabilization, in order to negate camera shake. If your budget allows, a telephoto zoom (18mm-300mm) is a great basic first choice. In addition, a tripod is very helpful and a macro lens is handy if you’re looking to shoot insects.
            </p>
            <p>Always Be Prepared</p>
            <p>
                Even if you’re not quite ready to head off on safari to capture images of the Big Five, making sure you and your equipment are well protected is very important. Invest in a sturdy, waterproof backpack to carry your camera gear, as well as wet-weather clothing and shoes to protect yourself. You could also consider a protective rain cover for your camera and lenses while in use.
            </p>
            <p>The Right Camera Settings</p>
            <p>
                If you’re serious about capturing wildlife images and you’re looking for the best possible results, it might be a good idea to get some professional training with a masterclass, but even a free online photography class can provide you with a good introduction as to the best settings to use. As a rule it’s generally advised you use a low ISO (100, 200) unless there is very little natural lighting available. Because animals can move quickly (unless your subject is a turtle of course!) a fast shutter speed is a must; you can get away with 1/1000th of a second if the animal is stationary, but 1/2000th is advised for birds and animals on the move. In terms of focus, while of course there’s scope for your personal creativity and composition, when you’re starting out it’s a good idea to set your camera to autofocus.
            </p>
            <p>Study your Subject</p>
            <p>
                Finally, it can be very useful to do some prior field observation or desktop research on the animals you intend to take pictures of. Understanding their behaviour and habits can come in very handy in terms of being able to predict what they may do – although nothing is guaranteed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Get More Tips in a Free Online Photography Class
            </p>
            <p>
                Get More Tips in a Free Online Photography Class
            </p>
            <p>
                Capturing an image of an animal, whether in the wild, at a zoo or even in a domestic or farm setting can yield magnificent results if you put in a bit of work and understand the many challenges you’ll be faced with. Take a free online photography course, watch how other experts work (both in person and in a masterclass if possible), and remember to expect the unexpected. You could surprise even yourself with what you can achieve.

            <h1>Do Rolex Watches Worth the Hefty Price Tags?</h1>
            <h6>by STELLA LILIA</h6>
            <p>
                Ask anyone in the world to name the most luxurious watch brand, and you will get almost universally the answer – Rolex. It is perceived as an affiliated status symbol and a standard of consistent quality for more than a century. Rolex is one of the leading Swiss watchmakers that define the benchmarks of the horology industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the terms ‘Rolex’ and ‘very expensive’ are used almost simultaneously. Indeed, specific Rolex watches can you an arm and a leg. But are Rolex watches worthy of the expensive price tags? Here we will look at the reasons behind their much heftier prices and whether they are worth that price.
            </p>
            <h2>The design speaks a lot</h2>
            <p>
                Rolex watches come with a superior design that reflects the impeccable efforts of countless designers working in the brand’s factory. It takes several years to design, and every single detail is incorporated with great attention. Instantly recognisable, a Rolex timepiece is designed and produced to perfection. And it naturally takes both quality resources and time to achieve it.
            </p>
            <h3>Not any ordinary materials used</h3>
            <p>
                This Swiss watchmaker leaves no stones unturned to achieve the level of perfection and quality it has set for its watches. Most of the materials that Rolex uses to craft its timepieces are manufactured in the brand’s factory, such as their patented Oystersteel and Everose gold. 

                 So Rolex’s efforts and dedication to such extensive lengths in developing own elements for their watches naturally get reflected in the price. But what you finally wrap around your wrist is an incredibly high-quality timepiece that could last for generations. 

                Besides, the brand also uses many costly materials like diamonds and mother-of-pearl, to design the watches. This eventually elevates Rolex prices. 
            </p>
            <h4>Everything is done in-house</h4>
            <p>
                Striving for perfection, Rolex makes every single part of its watches in-house. The watchmaker invests on ample amount of quality resources for managing the entire manufacturing process in the factory. More significantly, while manoeuvering everything in-house, Rolex can maintain each timepiece's quality and reliability.
            </p>
            <h5>Going above and beyond</h5>
            <p>
                When it comes to the use of materials, Rolex goes above and beyond. They use 904L steel that is much shinier and stronger than the standard 316L stainless steel. This steel is more complex to produce and more expensive to purchase. 

                Additionally, the watchmaker employs 18ct white gold for the indexes instead of steel to restrain tarnishing. This attention to small details makes Rolex stand out of others, and it also contributes to the price. 
            </p>
            <h6>A luxury item</h6>
            <p>
                A Rolex watch is merely a luxury item, and we have to pay a considerable sum of money to secure a luxury asset. Durability and quality are paramount in luxury objects. It is virtually impossible to find a flaw in a Rolex watch as the brand accepts no mistakes and deviation while making it, and the hefty price tag reflects this efficiency. 
            </p>
            <h7>Resale value</h7>
            <p>
                The added peace of mind that a Rolex timepiece offers when making your purchase is its second hand value. Virtually all Rolex watches hold excellent value with time, and some models can even appreciate. Whether it is broken or without its original box and papers, a Rolex timepiece will be still valuable. Recall the saying ‘you get what you pay for’. 
            </p>
            <h8>
                Conclusion
            </h8>
            <p>
                When investing in a Rolex watch, you are not only paying for a luxury item but also for the glorious heritage, fame and status that Rolex enjoys. A luxury watch today no longer serves as only a time-telling device. It portrays one’s personality, style and success. A Rolex watch is durable, precise, comfortable, and something that can bring a smile on your face whenever you look at it. Thus, it is obvious for Rolex watches to be expensive, and they undoubtedly worth that price.

            <h1>The Most Common Types of Websites Explained</h1>
            <h6> BY DALE HARRIS</h6>
            <p>
                There are over 1.7 million websites worldwide, a number that climbs every day. Whether you’re considering joining that number or wondering what kinds of different websites you can check out, you might be interested to know that the majority of websites fall into a few common categories. Here are some of the most popular types of websites, with examples.
            </p>
            <h2>1. E-commerce Websites</h2>
            <p>
                These popular websites allow you to sell products to people online. Examples of this type of site include big-box retailers like Amazon or Best Buy, as well as companies like Etsy that sell handmade products. Websites that offer the ability to put items in a cart and check out quality as e-commerce websites.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Business Website</h2>
            <p>
                These kinds of websites act as dedicated online addresses for a specific business or brand. A business website will list a company’s products, services, or past work. It will also include contact information to encourage potential customers to get in touch.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Personal or Portfolio Websites</h3>
            <p>
                These are cousins to business websites, as they showcase the contact information, products, services, and work of an individual. However, they often focus on past work, acting as a literal portfolio to highlight what an individual can accomplish.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Entertainment Websites</h4>
            <p>
                These popular website options are great for anyone with a taste for humorous or interesting content. Sites like Buzzfeed offer listicles and critiques on pop culture, for example, and sites like CollegeHumor present funny entertainment.
            </p>
            <h5>5. Media Websites</h5>
            <p>
                As you’d expect, media websites offer collections of articles, videos, and guides for their readers. They can overlap with entertainment websites, as in the case of The Onion, but the most prominent include media properties that also exist as newspapers or print magazines, such as The Washington Post or National Geographic.
            </p>
            <h6>6. Educational Websites</h6>
            <p>
                Now more than ever, people are learning online—and educational websites are what makes this possible. These websites can include the websites of universities and other institutions, or they may include sites like Coursera, which offers online distance learning from a variety of sources.
            </p>
            <h7>7. Blogs</h7>
            <p>
                Blogs come in many shapes and sizes these days, with some of them offering videos and photos while others stick to the traditional, text-based “web logs” that gave blogs their name. From major brands to your neighbor next door, blogs are popular tools to discuss a huge variety of topics.
            </p>
            <h8>8. Landing Pages</h8>
            <p>
                Popular with businesses and major brands, landing pages are designed to get a reader to follow through on a single course of action, like buying a product or downloading a guide. The best of them take advantage of web design services to ensure they have a great, eye-catching appearance and powerful content.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are just a few of the most popular websites people use and create on a daily basis, but there are countless other types to choose from. If you’re interested in creating a website of your own, consider the websites above, as well as the websites you often interact with, as you narrow down your options.
            </p>
            <h9>Consider the Types of Websites You See</h9>

            <h1>Laptop Configuration Guide: What Spec Do I Need?</h1>
            <h9> BY DALE HARRIS</h9>
            <p>
                Did you know that the Fugaku computer in Japan is currently the fastest supercomputer in the world? It has more than 7 million cores and it will become fully operational in April 2021. Its configuration is capable of handling supercomplex problems including medical research, weather forecast, and more.

                Although no machine matches the specs of the Fugaku supercomputer, it’s good to know more about a computer’s configuration. For example, your laptop configuration dictates your gaming experience and work productivity.

                If you plan to buy a new laptop, make sure that you know more about its specs. Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about laptop specs and how to configure your laptop.
            </p>
            <h2>Make Sure That You Have at Least 8GB of RAM</h2>
            <article>
                The random-access memory is more important than you might think. This is the place where applications and programs are run. The more RAM you have, the better. In our day and age, it’s recommended to have at least 8GB of RAM installed on your laptop.

                Anything less than that will make multitasking difficult, even if you’re a casual laptop user. 8GBs of RAM is usually sufficient to keep a few browser tabs open, listen to music, maybe run a game in the background, etc.

                If your budget is higher, you should go for 12GB or 16GB of RAM. This is ideal if you spend a lot of time in front of your computer and you run complex apps/games. Find out if your laptop’s RAM is also expandable. It’s nice to have a free slot where you can add 8 more GBs of RAM in the future if necessary.
            </article>
            <h3>If You Watch a Lot of Movies, Go for a Larger Screen</h3>
            <article>
                You can do so much on a laptop these days such as playing games, working, rendering video files, watching movies, etc. If Netflix is your best friend and you like to spend a lot of time watching movies, make sure that you get a laptop with a screen size of at least 15.6 inches.

                This is the standard size for most laptops designed for movies and games. If you want even more visual real estate, go for a laptop with a 17.3-inch screen. This is probably the largest display size you can go for in a laptop and it offers you an immersive viewing experience.

                On the other hand, if you travel a lot and you take the laptop with you, it’s recommended to go for a smaller display. Anything under 14 inches is advisable for those who want a portable laptop. Not only that your laptop will be lighter, but it will also fit almost all bags and cases with ease.
            </article>
            <h4>Opt for a Full HD Resolution</h4>
           <article>
            Display size and display resolution are two different things. The first refers to the physical size of the screen. The second refers to the number of pixels your screen has. The more pixels, the clearer the image. 

            There are several standard resolutions you can go for when it comes to a laptop’s display. The most popular are HD (1280 x 720 pixels), full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) and 4K (3840 x 2160 pixels). Ideally, you should go for a full HD resolution if your budget allows it.
            
            A full HD display is capable of showing crisper, clearer images, and more attractive colors. Your viewing experience will be taken to the next level and you’ll see a big difference when you play games too.
            
            If your budget allows you, it’s also a good idea to go for a 4K screen, but keep in mind that this will rapidly drain battery life. If you’re a casual user and don’t really care about display resolution, you could do fine with an HD screen too. Just that you won’t get the clearest and most vivid images possible.

           <h5>Go for an SSD if You Want a Fast Booting Time</h5>
           <article>
            SSD stands for a solid-state drive. It provides a better and more reliable way of storing data in comparison with the classic HDD. Most modern laptops come with an SSD configuration and this provides a plethora of advantages.

            First of all, SSD is insanely fast. You’ll be able to enjoy faster data transfer speeds and your operating system will load quicker too. Games run smoother when installed on SSD and so do other software programs and applications. The downside is that the SSD costs more.
            
            If you don’t plan on installing large games on your laptop, you might want to go for a configuration with 128GB or 256GB of SSD. This allows you to enjoy a smoother and quicker computer experience without spending too much money.
            
            On the other hand, if you plan to store large files on your laptop, go for a combination of SSD + HDD. install the operating system on the SSD to reap faster-loading speeds. Leave the HDD for large games, movies, and music collections.

           <h6>An i3 Is Good for Basic Needs, i5 and Higher for Advanced Users</h6>
           <article>
            Let’s talk about one of the most important components of your laptop – the CPU or central processing unit. This is the brain that makes your computer tick and puts all other components to work. If you have a high-performance CPU, chances are that your laptop will remain usable for years to come.

            Most laptops come with Intel processors because these are the most advanced. You could also go for the Ryzen processors from AMD. if you casually use your laptop and don’t need too much processing power, an Intel i3 processor should do the trick for you.
            
            This configuration is usually powerful enough to allow light multitasking, internet browsing, and playing videos on full HD resolution. However, if you want to play the latest games or render large video files, you need at least an i5 processor.
            
            Keep in mind that an i5 or i7 processor is designed for heavy users. If you plan to produce music with your laptop, edit large photos, or play the latest games, these are the processors you should look for. Be prepared to also take more money out of your pocket.
            
            Ideally, go for a processor that has at least 2 cores. Some of them have 4 or even 8 cores and this is a good thing when it comes to performance. Having more cores means that your computer is capable of doing more work and handling multitasking with ease.

           <h7>The Video Card Should Reflect Your Daily Computer Habits</h7>
           <article>
            Apart from the processor and RAM, there’s also the video card. This is a specially-designed component that handles images, animations, videos, and anything related to visuals. Most laptops come with an integrated video card, but if you want to play the latest games, you need a dedicated one.

            For example, try to go for at least 2GB of video RAM. This means that your laptop will have 2 additional GBs of RAM just to handle images and animations. Avid gamers usually go for about 4GB of video RAM and this allows you to play most games with the details set on “Ultra”.
            
            If you routinely edit photos or render videos in special software programs, you need a better video card as well. That’s why you should analyze your computer habits and see what’s best for you – a standard integrated video card for casual users or a high-performance one for gamers and videographers.

           <h8>Go for a Backlit Keyboard Because Why Not?</h8>
           <article>
            One of the most exciting features of a modern laptop is to have a backlit keyboard. Although most basic models don’t have this feature, it can be very practical and it’s worth spending more money to get it.

            Backlit keyboards allow you to easily type in the dark. You don’t need additional light sources, just your screen, and keyboard. Most models come with standard backlighting, but some gaming laptops allow you to configure an RGB keyboard.
            
            This means that you can assign it any color you want and even set specific colors for different groups of keys. Your laptop will look much more attractive and your gaming experience will be taken to the next level.
            
            Although you can do just fine without a backlit keyboard, why shouldn’t you have this cool feature? It adds personality to your laptop and it can increase your productivity. Be prepared to spend a little more money for a laptop with a backlit keyboard, but chances are that you won’t regret this decision.
           </article>
           <h8>Go Ahead and Find the Perfect Laptop Configuration for Your Needs!</h8>
           <article>
            Now that you’ve completed a quick course on laptop configuration and basic specs, it’s time to find your ideal machine. Go online and see multiple types of laptops with different configurations. This will help you narrow down your list and find a balance between price, performance, and portability.

            As a tip, write your priorities down. Do you use your laptop primarily for gaming? Are you a writer or videographer? Do you prefer to watch movies and online videos? Based on your preferences, you’ll eventually come up with the right decision.

            <h1>The Technology and Life Cycle of SSD - What You Need to Know</h1>
            <h6>By Nick Liu</h6>
            <article>
                With Flash Memory Summit approaching next week, I thought it would be a good time to dig into the technology and life cycle of the SSD. Unlike traditional hard drives, data storage data in SSDs is not on a magnetic surface, but rather inside of flash memory chips (NAND flash). By design, an SSD is made by a motherboard, a few memory chips (depending on the size in GB of the drive) and a controller which commands the SSD.
            </article>
            <article>
                The memory of SSDs is a non-volatile memory, in other words it's able to retain data even without power. We can imagine the data stored in the NAND flash chips as an electric charge preserved in each cell. With that in mind, the question arises: how long is the life span or life cycle of a SSD?
            </article>
            <article>
                The wear and tear of flash memory
                It is known that the writing operations wear out the memory cells of a SSD, reducing its life. But will the memories wear out all in the same way?
             </article>
            <article> 
                The memory used in flash chips is not all the same, there are actually three types of NAND:

                SLC (Single Level Cell) - 1 bits of data per cell
                MLC (Multi Level Cell) - 2 bits of data per cell
                TLC (Triple Level Cell) or 3-bit MLC - three bits of data per cell
                You can see: The more levels a cell has, the more storage space bits have in a cell, resulting in the production of higher capacity chips. Thanks to the technological advances of today we have SSDs which are able to store several GBs and are at an affordable price. No wonder that a recent report shows that the TLC memory type should equal about 50% of total NAND chips by the end of 2015, with a cost of production of about 15% - 20% less compared to MCL chips.
            </article>
            <article>
                However, there is a downside: Adding more bits to the cells reduces their reliability, durability and performance. It is quite easy to determine the state (how much space it has) of a SLC cell, as it is either empty or full, while it is more difficult to do the same for MLC and TLC cells as they have multiple states. As a result a TLC cell requires 4 times the writing time and 2.5 times the reading time of a SLC cell. When discussing the life cycle of an SSD, storing multiple bits per cell also means to speed up the wear of the NAND memory.

               A memory cell is made by a floating-gate transistor. It consists of two gates, the Control gate and the Floating gate insulated by a layer of oxide (you can see a schematic representation on the right). Each time operations are performed, e.g. programming and erasing the cell, the oxide layer that traps electrons on the floating gate wears. Consequently, as the oxide layer is weakened an electron drain from the floating gate may occur.

            </article>
            <article>
                How long do SSDs last?
            </article>
            <article>
                This is the million dollar question, obviously it's not possible to give an exact answer but... continue to read!

                The trend in terms of SSD is to focus on developing products based on 3-bit MCL (TLC) memory. TLC memory is beginning to dominate the market for SSD. In common use, it seems that the 2-bit MLC technology is excessive in terms of durability and performance, not to mention the SLC whose necessity is dwindling and is almost completely disappearing. In other words, manufacturers are giving up an extended life cycle in favor of cost reduction to allow for the expansion of flash memory and their storage capacity.

                However, it is seems that there is no worry about the duration of a SSD. In an experiment conducted by The TechReport on 6 SSDs to understand how they can withstand write operations, 2 drives out of 6 have managed writing operations for 2 PB of data and all SSDs tested were able to write hundreds of TB without problems.

                Assuming a writing of 2TB per year, according to the results of the experiment, a SSD's life span would equal 1000 years (2PB = 2000 TB / 2TB year = 1000 years). Even with an increased amount of data written to them, we would be able to use our SSD quietly for years and years and years.

            <p>
                Today pollution is a big problem in the whole world. India also included in this problem. Many reasons for this problem are two-wheeler vehicles, four-wheeler vehicles, air conditioner and many more. But vehicles are more responsible for this because petrol and diesel are the main source of carbon dioxide, carbon mono oxide and many hazardous gases. If we find out the sustainable solution to this problem, then the result is very positive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The electric vehicle is the best solution and replaces petrol & diesel vehicles. Future of electric vehicle is very bright, everyone lives in a healthy environment so "go drive go green”. Electric vehicles are not generated by hazardous gases and make healthy environment. Electric cars offer a low operational cost. There are many types of electric cars, such as:-
